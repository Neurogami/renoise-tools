{"name":"Renoise Tools","tagline":"Improving Renoise with lua scripting in every which way","body":"# Renoise Tools by Cas\r\nThis project consists of a handful (40+) of tools to make operating music making software [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com) easier. Short descriptions for all of these are also available, on my [web page](http://beatcreators.wordpress.com/tools-for-renoise/).\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\nYou can install, and update, all tools right into your Renoise user-scripts folder in a *nix-based OS:\r\n\r\n    $ cd ~/.renoise/V2.8.1/Scripts/Tools\r\n    $ git clone github.com/casmarrav/renoise-tools\r\n\r\nThen git will make a folder 'renoise-tools', you will have to manually move everything in there one level up, making sure you don't forget all the .dotfiles (.git dir, .gitignore).\r\nOn Windows the same method can be used; the directory you need to look for is \r\n\r\n    %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Renoise\\V2.8.1\\Scripts\\Tools\\\r\n\r\nOf course, if you don't need the auto-updates, you can also download the zip and extract it into the same folder.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\nSome of the tools are hard to find inside Renoise once installed: these only add features accessible through keyboard commands. An example of this is the Instrument Mixer, a very handy command window that allows the Renoise user to view and adjust various settings of multiple samples in an instrument at once. A very 'invisible' tool is Auto Select Instrument. It is no more than a variation on the function that is available in Renoise - in that it doesn't switch instruments on a pattern advance/change, only on track change. You can set a custom keyboard shortcut for toggling its functionality on and off in Renoises preferences window.\r\n### Overtune Synth/Sample Generator\r\nThe Overtune tool is pretty complex, which is why it has gotten its [own page at my blog](http://beatcreators.wordpress.com/overtune/).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Support the project\r\nI have written over 15K lines of code in this project on my own.
