Renoise Tools by Cas
====================

This project consists of a handful of tools to make operating music making software [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com) easier. Description of any of these is also available on my [web page](http://beatcreators.wordpress.com/tools-for-renoise/).
All of the code in this repository is released under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/); you are especially encouraged to (re)use it and learn from it. If you use it for derivative works it is not forbidden to give me credit as Cas Marrav or point to this [online business card](http://about.me/casmarrav).
